### Hi there, I'm Dimas ðŸ‘‹

I am a student still learning about many things. I love creating something out of code and seeing the works that people had made. Currently learning the basics of coding and trying to go deeper. Currently i have a big interest in Game Development and Web Development and trying to learn those two subjects at my own pace!
